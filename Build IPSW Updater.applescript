			-- GOOGLE CLOSURE COMPILER OPTION NOTES:
			-- The following compilation/minification results in about 95 KB space savings of the JXA source code (about 180 KB down to about 85 KB).

			-- Set "--language_in 'ECMASCRIPT_2018'" so that it will error if any JavaScript features are used that may not be supported on macOS 10.13 High Sierra (which I found to support ES2018 and NOT ES2019 by manually checking for newer language features).
			-- Set "--assume_function_wrapper" so that top level global names are also renamed (not just names within functions) to save space since those names are never referenced from the main wrapper script (this results in about 16 KB extra space savings vs not using this option).
			-- Set "--formatting 'SINGLE_QUOTES'" only because I prefer defaulting to single quoted strings, but it's not really necessary and shouldn't make a difference to the code either way.
			-- NOTE: Even though Google Closure Compiler will rename variables and functions, there should be no conflicts with the variable names in the main wrapper script since the code will be run via "eval()" which appears to be its own block scope and none of the variables or function are called outside of "eval()" after it runs.

# and it MUST be signed so that the 'AssociatedBundleIdentifier' key can be used in macOS 13 Ventura so that the LaunchAgent is properly displayed as being for the IPSW Updater app.
# This is because the executable in the LaunchAgent MUST have a Code Signing Team ID that matches the Team ID of the app Bundle ID specified in the 'AssociatedBundleIdentifiers' key (as described in https://developer.apple.com/documentation/servicemanagement/updating_helper_executables_from_earlier_versions_of_macos?language=objc#4065210).
# We DO NOT want to have the LaunchAgent just run the 'IPSW Updater' app binary directly because if the app is launched that way via the LaunchAgent and then the LaunchAgent is removed during that execution the app will be terminated immediately when 'launchctl bootout' is run.
# That issue has always been avoided by using the '/usr/bin/open' binary to launch the app instead. But using '/usr/bin/open' directly in the LaunchAgent on macOS 13 Ventura makes it show as just running 'open' from an unidentified developer in the new Login Items list, which may seem suspicious or confusing.
# Making this simple SIGNED script that just runs '/usr/bin/open' and then using the 'AssociatedBundleIdentifiers' allows the LaunchAgent to be properly displayed as being for the 'IPSW Updater' app.
# When on macOS 12 Monterey and older, the 'AssociatedBundleIdentifiers' will just be ignored and the 'Launch IPSW Updater' will function the same as if we directly specified '/usr/bin/open' with the path to the app in the LaunchAgent.
# Search for 'AssociatedBundleIdentifiers' in the 'IPSW Updater.jxa' script to see the LaunchAgent creation code.
